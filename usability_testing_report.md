# Usability Testing & Reflection Report

**Project:** Personal Resume Website — Abraham GATLUAK  
**Course:** HCI — 4th Year IT  
**Instructor:** Osman

## Goals
- Verify navigation clarity and content scannability.
- Test responsiveness across mobile and desktop.
- Confirm accessibility features (alt text, keyboard navigation, color contrast).

## Methods
- Informal testing with 5 participants (peers), tasks:
  1. Find and download the resume PDF.
  2. Locate contact email.
  3. Summarize education and experience.
- Observations recorded, basic SUS-style subjective feedback gathered.

## Results (summary)
- All participants completed tasks successfully.
- Minor issues: contact link not prominent for one participant; suggested larger CTA.
- Mobile layout tested; buttons and links were tappable.

## Changes made
- Added a clear "Download Resume" button.
- Improved color contrast and increased font sizes for headings.
- Included skip link and semantic landmarks for keyboard users.

## Reflection
Design decisions prioritized clarity and accessibility. Future iterations: add portfolio project pages, add ARIA labels to dynamic controls, and perform a formal Lighthouse audit.
